## How can SM Flights offer such cheap flights?

_Unlocking the Secrets to SM Flights' Affordable Airfare_

Finding a great deal on flights can feel like striking gold. SM Flights has become a
go-to for low-cost tickets. But what’s their secret? Let’s dive in:

### Wholesale Fares

At the heart of SM Flights’ success is our direct access to consolidators, and
wholesale fares. These special rates aren’t typically available to the public, offering
significant savings compared to standard retail prices. Through innovative
partnerships, we tap into these fares and pass the savings on to you.

### Airline Relationships

We have well-established relationships with over 200 global airlines, including direct
partnerships with more than 70 carriers. These connections grant us exclusive
access to the most competitive rates, allowing us to negotiate deals often below
market value.

### Mix and Match Airlines

One of our strategies is to mix and match airlines to find the best prices. Using
proprietary technology and Global Distribution Systems (GDSs), our travel agents
compare all available flights with our internal rates, uncovering the lowest
unpublished fares and exclusive deals.

### Exclusive Search Engines

We have access to search engines that aren’t available to the public. This allows us
to scour a broader range of flight options, including special offers hidden from
everyday consumers.

### Smart Itinerary Planning

We demonstrate a knack for combining layovers in a way that balances cost savings
with comfort. Our agents craft itineraries that may include longer layovers but result
in significantly cheaper flights.

### Flexible Deals

Travelers with flexible schedules can benefit from cheaper flight options. We offer
lower-priced deals to those who can adjust their travel dates.

### Last-Minute Offers

Contrary to popular belief, last-minute travel doesn’t always have to be expensive.
We’re known for securing great last-minute deals, making spontaneous trips
affordable.
